# PUREVOLUME

PUREVOLUME was built to deliver music, pop culture, and entertainment news to a Millenial audience in an efficient, user-friendly and readable manner. With clean UX/UI, lots of white-space to go easy on the eyes, and a pop of colour to keep it fresh and bring it all together, we think you'll have just as much fun reading about your favourite celebrities, as we had creating the site for you to do it on.
